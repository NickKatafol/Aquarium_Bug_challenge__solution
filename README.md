# The Feedback Competition

Dear Exam Vue.js team,
I CHALLENGE YOU TO the Feedback Competition.

Thank you! üòéÔ∏èü§òÔ∏è


## The project description

There is the Aquarium.
- If you click on the button "Add the random fish" the Fish is appired moving along a random direction.
- If you click on the Fish it will disapire.


It's the version with the bugs. <br> 
The solution I'll send you shortly then.


## The bugs description

1. If you click on the button "Add the random fish" the Fish is appired but NO moving at all.
2. If you click on the Fish it will NOT disapire.

>**Hint**: <br>
> The first bug includes the 2 separate causes. <br>
> For the both bugs it will be enough to work only with the **/components/Fish.vue** Component.


## The Challenge Rules

In the Exam you are allowed 75 minutes for 2 tasks, 2/3 of the time for the biggest one and 1/3 for the bug task. <br> 
So you hold only **20 minutes to fix 2 bags**. <br>
You should work alone without an any help.

The Remainder Back Counter is in the right top corner of the page. 




## Project Setup

```sh
